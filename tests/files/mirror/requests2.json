There's no need to manually add query strings to your\nURLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling\nare 100% automatic, powered by `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_,\nwhich is embedded within Requests.\n\nBesides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most\ndownloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000 downloads\nevery month. You don't want to be left out!\n\nFeature Support\n---------------\n\nRequests is ready for today's web.\n\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style SSL Verification\n- Basic/Digest Authentication\n- Elegant Key/Value Cookies\n- Automatic Decompression\n- Automatic Content Decoding\n- Unicode Response Bodies\n- Multipart File Uploads\n- HTTP(S) Proxy Support\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Streaming Downloads\n- ``.netrc`` Support\n- Chunked Requests\n\nRequests officially supports Python 2.6‚Äì2.7 & 3.3‚Äì3.7, and runs great on PyPy.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install Requests, simply:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install requests\n    ‚ú®üç∞‚ú®\n\nSatisfaction, guaranteed.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFantastic documentation is available at http://docs.python-requests.org/, for a limited time only.\n\n\nHow to Contribute\n-----------------\n\n#.

Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :) Make sure to add yourself to AUTHORS_.\n\n.. _`the repository`: http://github.com/kennethreitz/requests\n.. _AUTHORS: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst\n.. _Contributor Friendly: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues?direction=desc&labels=Contributor+Friendly&page=1&sort=updated&state=open\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nRelease History\n---------------\n\n2.16.0 (2017-05-26)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Unvendor ALL the things!\n\n2.15.1 (2017-05-26)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Everyone makes mistakes.\n\n2.15.0 (2017-05-26)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next\n  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).\n- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.\n\n2.14.2 (2017-05-10)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to\n  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.\n\n2.14.1 (2017-05-09)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip\n  releases.\n\n2.14.0 (2017-05-09)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``\n  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment\n  variable.\n- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories\n  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS\n  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.\n- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.\n  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling\n  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly\n  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers['location']``.\n  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.\n- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher\n  resolution on Windows.\n- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra\n  on Windows with Python 2.7.\n- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass\n  check doesn't use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore\n- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``\n  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.\n  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now\n  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.\n- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now\n  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.\n- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX\n  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.\n- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.\n- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\\\``) no longer has a big head. I'm sure\n  this is what you were all worrying about most.\n\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.\n- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.\n- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.\n- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.\n\n2.13.0 (2017-01-24)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features**\n\n- Only load the ``idna`` library when we've determined we need it. This will\n  save some memory for users.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.\n- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.\n\n2.12.5 (2017-01-18)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting\n  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.\n\n2.12.4 (2016-12-14)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the\n  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,\n  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.\n\n2.12.3 (2016-12-01)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with \"http\".\n  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed\n  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an\n  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This\n  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to\n  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.\n\n2.12.2 (2016-11-30)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but\n  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if\n  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will\n  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using\n  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid\n  but still common hostnames.\n- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise\n  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.\n- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still\n  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.\n- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.\n- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a\n  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an\n  ``AttributeError``.\n\n2.12.1 (2016-11-16)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Updated setuptools 'security' extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.\n\n2.12.0 (2016-11-15)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.\n  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory\n  for .de domains.\n- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no\n  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.\n- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for\n  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.\n- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but\n  do have a ``seek`` method.\n- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary\n  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.\n- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than\n  stripping the credentials.\n- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is\n  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to\n  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated\n  through to non-urllib3 backends.\n- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred\n  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.\n- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling\n  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.\n- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when\n  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native\n  string type for the platform.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.\n- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.\n\n2.11.1 (2016-08-17)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for\n  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in\n  2.11.\n- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when\n  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.\n\n2.11.0 (2016-08-08)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.\n- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to\n  reduce risk of header smuggling.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that\n  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.\n- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``\n  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.\n- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure\n  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).\n- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and\n  ``None`` for chunk sizes.\n- Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have\n  the underlying connection closed but not returned to the connection pool,\n  which could cause Requests to hang in situations where the ``HTTPAdapter``\n  had been configured to use a blocking connection pool.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.\n- Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as acceptable header values. This release does not.\n\n2.10.0 (2016-04-29)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n**New Features**\n\n- SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks; ``$ pip install requests[socks]``)\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.\n\n2.9.2 (2016-04-29)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict\n  as its underlying datastore.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Don't use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False\n- When passed objects that throw exceptions from ``tell()``, send them via\n  chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.\n- Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.\n\n2.9.1 (2015-12-21)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to send binary\n  strings as bodies in Python 3.\n- Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain locales.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.\n\n2.9.0 (2015-12-15)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)\n\n- The ``verify`` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a\n  directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.\n- Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.\n- Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the status code\n  registry.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- For file-like objects that are not seeked to the very beginning, we now\n  send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather\n  than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.\n- When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no obvious\n  content length we set ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` rather than\n  ``Content-Length: 0``.\n- We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading chunked\n  bodies.\n- We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python 3, by\n  decoding it as UTF-8.\n- Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when using the\n  functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to\n  clean them up.\n- Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed ``qop`` directive that\n  contains no token, by treating it the same as if no ``qop`` directive was\n  provided at all.\n- Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by name.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.13.\n\n2.8.1 (2015-10-13)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Update certificate bundle to match ``certifi`` 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate\n  bundle.\n- Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ``ConnectTimeout`` instead of\n  ``ConnectionError``\n- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the\n  ``json`` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.\n- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a\n  Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.\n\n2.8.0 (2015-10-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)\n\n- Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the ``proxies``\n  dictionary to have entries of the form\n  ``{'<scheme>://<hostname>': '<proxy>'}``. Host-specific proxies will be used\n  in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the\n  previous syntax will continue to work.\n- ``Response.raise_for_status`` now prints the URL that failed as part of the\n  exception message.\n- ``requests.utils.get_netrc_auth`` now takes an ``raise_errors`` kwarg,\n  defaulting to ``False``. When ``True``, errors parsing ``.netrc`` files cause\n  exceptions to be thrown.\n- Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle\n  requests downstream.\n- Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now\n  contains only the requests version.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- The ``json`` parameter to ``post()`` and friends will now only be used if\n  neither ``data`` nor ``files`` are present, consistent with the\n  documentation.\n- We now ignore empty fields in the ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable.\n- Fixed problem where ``httplib.BadStatusLine`` would get raised if combining\n  ``stream=True`` with ``contextlib.closing``.\n- Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to\n  the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.\n- Miscellaneous minor internal changes.\n- Digest Auth support is now thread safe.\n\n**Updates**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.12.\n\n2.7.0 (2015-05-03)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see\n`our documentation\n<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/community/release-process/>`_.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer\n  encoding and response framing.\n\n2.6.2 (2015-04-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not\n  properly decompressed. (#2561)\n\n2.6.1 (2015-04-22)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.\n\n- Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to\n  pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. #2552)\n\n- Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to\n  the adapter. (#2503)\n\n- Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that\n  cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)\n\n- Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest\n  Authentication. (#2426)\n\n- Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an instance\n  of RequestsCookieJar. (#2527)\n\n2.6.0 (2015-03-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie\n  without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL\n  exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie\n  stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of\n  `BugFuzz <https://bugfuzz.com>`_. This affects all versions of requests from\n  v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).\n\n- Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python\n  setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)\n\n- Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the\n  vendored import location.\n\n- Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.\n\n- Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n- Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.\n  (#2468)\n\n- Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or\n  ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.\n\n2.5.3 (2015-02-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see\n  (#2455, #2456, and http://bugs.python.org/issue23476)\n\n2.5.2 (2015-02-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n- Add sha256 fingerprint support. (`shazow/urllib3#540`_)\n\n- Improve the performance of headers. (`shazow/urllib3#544`_)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove\n  requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those\n  same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party\n  libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having\n  to fallback to the system urllib3.\n\n- Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting\n  fails. (#2356)\n\n- Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)\n\n- Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication\n  challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (#2408)\n\n- Fix a socket leak. (`shazow/urllib3#549`_)\n\n- Fix multiple ``Set-Cookie`` headers properly. (`shazow/urllib3#534`_)\n\n- Disable the built-in hostname verification. (`shazow/urllib3#526`_)\n\n- Fix the behaviour of decoding an exhausted stream. (`shazow/urllib3#535`_)\n\n**Security**\n\n- Pulled in an updated ``cacert.pem``.\n\n- Drop RC4 from the default cipher list. (`shazow/urllib3#551`_)\n\n.. _shazow/urllib3#551: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/551\n.. _shazow/urllib3#549: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/549\n.. _shazow/urllib3#544: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544\n.. _shazow/urllib3#540: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/540\n.. _shazow/urllib3#535: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/535\n.. _shazow/urllib3#534: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/534\n.. _shazow/urllib3#526: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/526\n\n2.5.1 (2014-12-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Behavioural Changes**\n\n- Only catch HTTPErrors in raise_for_status (#2382)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Handle LocationParseError from urllib3 (#2344)\n- Handle file-like object filenames that are not strings (#2379)\n- Unbreak HTTPDigestAuth handler.

Raised instead of ``urllib3``\n  ``DecodeError`` exceptions.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Avoid many many exceptions from the buggy implementation of ``proxy_bypass`` on OS X in Python 2.6.\n- Avoid crashing when attempting to get authentication credentials from ~/.netrc when running as a user without a home directory.\n- Use the correct pool size for pools of connections to proxies.\n- Fix iteration of ``CookieJar`` objects.\n- Ensure that cookies are persisted over redirect.\n- Switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.\n\n2.1.0 (2013-12-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Updated CA Bundle, of course.\n- Cookies set on individual Requests through a ``Session`` (e.g. via ``Session.get()``) are no longer persisted to the ``Session``.\n- Clean up connections when we hit problems during chunked upload, rather than leaking them.\n- Return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful, rather than leaking it.\n- Match the HTTPbis recommendation for HTTP 301 redirects.\n- Prevent hanging when using streaming uploads and Digest Auth when a 401 is received.\n- Values of headers set by Requests are now always the native string type.\n- Fix previously broken SNI support.\n- Fix accessing HTTP proxies using proxy authentication.\n- Unencode HTTP Basic usernames and passwords extracted from URLs.\n- Support for IP address ranges for no_proxy environment variable\n- Parse headers correctly when users override the default ``Host:`` header.\n- Avoid munging the URL in case of case-sensitive servers.\n- Looser URL handling for non-HTTP/HTTPS urls.\n- Accept unicode methods in Python 2.6 and 2.7.\n- More resilient cookie handling.\n- Make ``Response`` objects pickleable.\n- Actually added MD5-sess to Digest Auth instead of pretending to like last time.\n- Updated internal urllib3.\n- Fixed @Lukasa's lack of taste.\n\n2.0.1 (2013-10-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Updated included CA Bundle with new mistrusts and automated process for the future\n- Added MD5-sess to Digest Auth\n- Accept per-file headers in multipart file POST messages.\n- Fixed: Don't send the full URL on CONNECT messages.\n- Fixed: Correctly lowercase a redirect scheme.\n- Fixed: Cookies not persisted when set via functional API.\n- Fixed: Translate urllib3 ProxyError into a requests ProxyError derived from ConnectionError.\n- Updated internal urllib3 and chardet.\n\n2.0.0 (2013-09-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**API Changes:**\n\n- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,\n  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.\n- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception\n  will be raised if they don't.\n- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.\n- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.\n- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.\n- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This\n  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on\n  the ``Session``.\n- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This\n  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the\n  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.\n- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.\n  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.\n- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding\n  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.\n- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``\n  exception to be raised.\n- HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``\"im_used\"``. Correctly uses\n  ``\"already_reported\"``.\n- HTTP 226 reason added (``\"im_used\"``).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n- Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb.

to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication\n  from the proxy url\n- Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s\n- Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes\n- Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the\n  ``Response.json()`` method\n- Don't send ``Content-Length`` header by default on ``GET`` or ``HEAD``\n  requests\n- Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request\n  took.\n- Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``\n- Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the\n  multiprocessing library\n- Update charade to version
